Liver Ultrasound Vascular Tracking Task in Accurate Radiotherapy Guided by Ultrasound  
- Python trains the YoloV5-Tiny detection model and converts it into a Libtorch model
- C++ postprocesses it and generates a DLL file
- Based on C# winform, an interface for visualizing vascular motion curves is developed

# Effect
Real-time detection and frame rate of around 70FPS can be achieved
